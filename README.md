We created a 2D PC game with Unity.

In this game, you play as a flying cat who just wanna fly home, but the road ahead isn't safe.
Using only one key ("Space"), you need to pass all your enemies and collect many coins as you can in order to get to the next level.
The game contains 3 stages, with gradually increasing difficulty. 
There is a tutorial level, of course, for those who want to exercise with the mechanics of the game.
